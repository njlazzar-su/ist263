//Three ways to declare variables

var myName = "Nick" //Var declaration can be used throughout the entire code

let ourName = "Pike" //Let can only be used within the scope in which its declared

const pi = 3.14 //Const can never change

//Declaring variables

var a; //Here we are simply declaring a variable

var b = 2; //Here we declare the variable "b" and then assign a value of 2

a = 7; //Here we assign 7 to "a" we dont have to declare since it was already done

a = b; //Whatever the value of "b" is, is now "a"

console.log(a);

//Adding
