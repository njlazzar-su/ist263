                <h3>I'm A Front End Web Developer.</h3>


                <p>Nicholas is a Syracuse University sophomore who is pursuing a Bachelors’s Degree in Information Management and Technology with a concentration in Web Development in the iSchool. This summer, Nicholas plans to complete his first internship and he has begun applying to a handful of them already. Nicholas’s past employments include a sales associate for a liquor store in his hometown, where he helped manage inventory and customer relations. Nicholas also held the title of Transportation Expert, where he was tasked with accounting for and delivering hundreds of bottles of liquor, as well as gaining and retaining adequate knowledge of the local area. Nicholas has had a lot of customer service experience, but now plans to start his career journey with an internship. After college Nicholas plans to begin his career at a major tech company, or a startup.<br>
                    
                <br>He plans to be a front-end web developer. This job encapsulates building websites, user interfaces, and designs for both of these.  He has no preference as either would work for him. Outside of academics, Nicholas loves to play lacrosse and basketball. He also enjoys spending time with his friends, family, and his dog, back in his hometown of Closter, New Jersey.
