        <h1>Nick Lazzari's Bio</h1>

        <p>Hello, my name is Nicholas Lazzari and I am an Information Management & Technology major, who is pursuing a concentration in Web Development. <strong>I am interested in all types of front-end development.</strong> I have a very basic knowledge of Python, and over the summer I had begun learning swift.</p> 

        <h2>Personal Info</h2>

        <p>Outside of the classroom, some of my hobbies include playing lacrosse, watching football and basketball, and working out. I grew up in north Jersey (about 20 minutes outside NYC) with my mother, father, older brother, and my dog Stewie. Over the summer, I worked at two seperate jobs in my hometown which are as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Sales Associate and Floor Manager at Gary's Wine and Marketplace</li>
            <li>Delivery Driver at Hanami Sushi</li>
        </ol>
    
    <p>As I continue my journey at Syracuse, I look to further my knowledge in all things pertaining to front-end development, especially web design.</p>
